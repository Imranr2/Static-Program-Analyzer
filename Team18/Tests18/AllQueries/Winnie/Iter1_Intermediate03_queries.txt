1 - Basic: select entities without relation (stmt)
stmt s;
Select s
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
5000
2 - Basic: select with 1 non-transitive relation that does not involve the selected entity (follows)
print p;
Select p such that Follows(2, 3)
none
5000
3 - Intermediate: select with 1 non-transitive relation that involves a selected entity (modifies)
variable v;
Select v such that Modifies(12, v)
a, b
5000
4 - Intermediate: select with pattern that involves a selected entity (pattern)
assign a;
Select a pattern a(_, _"c"_) 
3, 13
5000
5 - Intermediate: select with 1 transitive relation that involves the selected entity (follows*)
if i; while w;
Select i such that Follows*(w, i)
12
5000
6 - Advanced: select with pattern + relation (one involves the selected entity) (modifies, pattern)
variable v; assign a;
Select v such that Modifies(3, v) pattern a("a", _"a"_)
a
5000
7 - Advanced: select with pattern + relation that both involve the selected entity (uses, pattern)
print p; variable v; assign a;
Select p such that Uses(p, v) pattern a(v, _"c"_)
4, 10
5000
8 - Advanced: select with relation that involves multiple declared entities (parent*, pattern)
assign a; while w;
Select a such that Parent*(w, a) pattern a(_, _)
